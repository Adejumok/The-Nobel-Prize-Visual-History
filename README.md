# The-Nobel-Prize-Visual-History
The first Nobel Prize was handed out in 1901, and at that time the Prize was very Eurocentric and male-focused, but nowadays it's not biased in any way whatsoever. This project aim to visually analyze the nobel prize data, and find out about this conclusion

## Introduction

In this project, we analyze data using Python to gain insights and answer questions. We use Jupyter Notebook to write our code and present our findings.

## Data

The data used in this project is a CSV file containing data on the Nobel Prize History. We import the data into our notebook and clean it as needed. The aim of this analysis is to find out if the Nobel Prize is no longer Eurocentric and male-focused.

## Analysis

We start by exploring the data and understanding its structure. We then use various Python libraries such as Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, and Seaborn to analyze the data and visualize our findings. We perform various data analysis tasks such as:

- Data cleaning and preparation
- Data exploration
- Data visualization
- Data modeling and prediction

## Results

We present our findings in this section using various visualizations such as graphs, charts, and tables. We also provide insights and interpretations of the data and answer the questions we set out to explore in the introduction.

## Conclusion

Well, as we suspected, non-typical genres such as children's movies and documentaries are all clustered around the bottom half of the plot. But we can't know for certain until we perform additional analyses. We are not certain that movies are getting shorter.

## Dependencies

This project requires the following Python libraries:

- Pandas
- Numpy
- Matplotlib

To install these libraries, run the following command:

```
!pip install pandas numpy matplotlib
```

## Usage

To use this project, clone the repository and run the Jupyter Notebook file in your local environment. Make sure to have the required dependencies installed.

## Credits

This project is a DataCamp Intermdiate Python Project.
